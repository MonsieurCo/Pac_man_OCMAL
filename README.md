# Pac_man_OCMAL
this is a pac man game made in ocaml for university

we have implemented the union find data structure and a random maze is generated on each launch
the bot is just reaching the player through wall for the moment and plays independently every 2 seconds

After some improvement the ghost is finding a path through the maze to find the palyer
